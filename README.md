# DrinkOasis

DrinkOasis emerges as a digital guide for cocktail enthusiasts. By connecting users with nearby cocktail bars and offering genuine reviews, we intend to elevate the art of cocktail-making and celebrate the establishments that perfect it. Moreover, this website implements a diary-like function, allowing users to share their experience while making drinks on their own.
